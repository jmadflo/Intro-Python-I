# For the exercise, look up the methods and functions that are available for use
# with Python lists.

# For the following, DO NOT USE AN ASSIGNMENT (=).

# Change x so that it is [1, 2, 3, 4]
# YOUR CODE HERE
x.append(4)

# Using y, change x so that it is [1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10]
# YOUR CODE HERE
x = x + y # can also use .extend(array_to_add)
print(x)

# Change x so that it is [1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10]
# YOUR CODE HERE
x.remove(8) # can also use .pop() to remove by index (defaults to 1)

# Change x so that it is [1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 99, 10]
# YOUR CODE HERE
x.insert(5, 99)

# Print the length of list x
# YOUR CODE HERE

# Print all the values in x multiplied by 1000
